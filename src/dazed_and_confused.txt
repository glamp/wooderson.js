MIKE CYNTHIA
Come on. Come on.

MIKE
It's going to be alright.

Okay, thank you.
MIKE
Welcome.

TONY
Well, okay, there I am, you know, and I'm getting it on, you know, with what has this perfect female body.
MIKE
Uh-huh.
TONY
But...
MIKE
What? What, what?
TONY
I can't say.
MIKE
Come on man, you can't give a build up like that and not deliver. Right. Come on, a perfect female body. It's not a bad start.
TONY
But the head of Abraham Lincoln.
MIKE
Ah.
TONY
I mean the hat and the beard. Oh well, let's not think too deeply on this one right?
MIKE
Best not.
TONY
I've got to get some stuff from Mr. Birchfield. I'll see you in a few minutes.
MIKE
Right. I'm sorry.
They depart in opposite directions 
SHAVONNE
(off)
Gilligan's Transistor Radio Map. Yeah, that was a good one.
INT. CLASSROOM 
Shavonne is writing Gillian's Island episodes on the blackboard.
SHAVONNE
Hey what about that one where that sexy surfer guy catches that huge wave and lands on the island. You remember that?
A few of them "yeah" with remembrance. 
JODI
The mosquitoes! Do you remember that. There were ...
DON
(off)
Pink let's go.
INT. CORRIDOR 3 
Don beckons Pink over. 
DON
Come on.
PINK
Hey. Look man, I can't go yet until Miss. Wilk gets here, so why don't you go get Benny and check me out on the way back, okay?
DON
Alright.
Don walks off but suddenly stops and turns. 
PINK
What?
DON
Coach gave me something to give to you.
Don hands Pink a piece of paper. Pink unfolds and starts to read it (a pledge from the athletics dep.). 
PINK
They're really doing this.
DON
Yeah. He wants them all back by the end of the day to. Can you believe that one?
PINK
And everybody's signing it?
DON
Just to get him off our back. I mean the coach is just being a fucking asshole do you know what I'm saying. I mean you sign it, never think about it again just let it go. You're going to make a big deal out of this aren't you?
INT. WOODWORK ROOM 
Slater test sucks on a bong made by Stoner next to him. 
SLATER
You're gettin' air from there man. It's no good. You see this? It's got to be tight. You're gunna have to put some gum around the base of that if you want to get a good hit man.
Don turns up at the door. 
DON
Slater.
SLATER
Benny.
Slater gets Benny's attention to Don with Gene Simmons style tongue and hand waving. Don hand signals "hurry up". Benny hand signals "a few more minutes". Slater speaks over them. 
SLATER
(off)
Man I ain't believing that shit about Bonham's one hour drum solo man. I mean one hour of drums, you couldn't handle that shit on strong acid man.
INT. CLASSROOM 
Shavonne and Kaye get up from a table Jodi follows. 
JODI
We're going to go to the bathroom could you guys let Miss. Wilks know?
Pink and Cynthia are sat at the next table, Tony leans against the one in the background. Mike comes over and sits down. 
MIKE
Alright. This is totally amazing. "I voluntarily agree to not indulge in any alcohol, drugs or engage in any other illegal activity that may in any way jeopardize the years of hard work we as a team have committed to our goal of a championship season in '76."
PINK
That's bullshit.
TONY
You guys are actually signing this crap?
PINK
Apparently.
CYNTHIA
God what are they going to do next? Give you guys urine tests or something?
MIKE
See I just didn't know that drugs and alcohol were such a big problem that they had to resort to neo-McCarthyism.
PINK
No, I think that they're just afraid that some of us might be having just too good a time.
MIKE
See it's all this depressing youth thing you know?
TONY
Neo-McCarthyism. I like that!
MIKE
Oh, that's good Tony.
INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM 
Kaye puts away some lipstick, Jodi is just standing around, Shavonne is smoking a cig. 
KAYE
And there you guys were in class trying to list all the Gillian's Island episodes with out even a hint of irony.
SHAVONNE
What in the hell are you talking about girl?
KAYE
You weren't thinking about it were you?
SHAVONNE
Gilligan's Island?
KAYE
It's what's called the male pornographic fantasy.
SHIZ
Oh my.
KAYE
Think about it. You're basically alone on a deserted island with two readily available women. One a seductive sex goddess type. The other a healthy girl next door type with a nice butt. So guys have it all. The madonna and the whore. Women get nothing. We get a geek. An over-weight middle aged guy. Some nerdy scientific type I mean...
JODI
The professor is sexy.
INT. CORRIDOR 2 
Benny holds up his bat. Next to him is Don. 
DON
Pink! Come on man.
BENNY
We're off to raise some hell. Look at that, look at that!
PINK
Nice.
The three mumble some stuff and walk off. Jodi emerges from the bathroom, catches them up. 
DON
Right let's go kick some ass.
JODI
You guys. Guys. Wait up. Benny.
BENNY
What?
JODI
Benny, I have a favor to ask ya.
BENNY

JODI

BENNY

JODI

BENNY

JODI
Well just don't give him any more than the other guys. Any of you. He's kind of little, alright?
PINK
You got our word sis. Little brother will be okay.
JODI
Thanks. See you guys.
She walks way. Benny whacks her on the ass with his bat. 
JODI
Oh! Benny! These guys I don't know...
She continues on joining Shavonne and Kaye. 
DON
Oh there was just a little bit of bullshit in all that right?
BENNY
Major bullshit, he's a dead man. He's fucking dead.
They turn and head for the car. 
PINK DON
Shot gun. Shot gun.
INT. BENNY'S TRUCK

Those junior high kids are dead meat I promise them. I'm going beat 'em. Oh yeah.
EXT. JUNIOR SCHOOL 
Benny pulls up, stops. Gets out his microphone. 
BENNY
Okay you freshman fucks listen up. It's your lucky day. Usually you'd be spending your freshman summer getting your asses busted and running for your worthless little lives. But this year because we feel so sorry for you, we're going to take it easy on you. And save us all a lot of time. So if you meet here. right here. After school today. You only get one licking from each of us. But you run like cowards. Well it's open season all summer long boys. Oh yeah. Mitch Kramer.

EXT. LEE HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT 
Benny drives back up. 
BENNY

MELVIN

Benny parks and Pink notices 3 coaches. 
PINK
Shit.
BENNY
Hey coach.
ASSISTANT COACH
So tell me. Any 'you girls going to be ready to play some football this fall, huh?
All "oh yeah" 
BENNY
I don't know coach. You know I been doing so good in English classes you know. I figured I'd take next fall off and become a writer. What do ya think about that, huh?
ASSISTANT COACH
Boy, you wouldn't know how to write your name if it wasn't stenciled on your locker. No seriously everybody. Now don't go getting soft on me this summer. You know, you're sitting around the pool all day, chasing the muff around. Breakdown.
Don, Benny and Mel do so but Pink just turns away. 
Hell man. My grandmother's quicker and tougher than you pansies. 'Course she six three, two-fifty and runs a 4.5 forty.
Pink mutters to himself. 
ASSISTANT COACH
Hey what's the matter with you Floyd. Quarterback don't have to do what their coaches say it that it. Dawson, did you give him that pledge sheet?
DON
What?
ASSISTANT COACH
The pledge sheet, did you give it to him?
PINK
Yeah coach it's right here.
ASSISTANT COACH
Well Randy, if you could get that back to us by the end of the day we'd feel a lot better about it. You guys see that he does this, okay?
MELVIN
Alright coach.
General "see you coach". They walk on. 
COACH CONRAD
Randy Floyd.
PINK
Shit.
COACH CONRAD
Before next fall you're in need of a serious attitude adjustment young man. You better get your priorities straight. And watch out for that other crowd you're running with. Don't think I haven't noticed. Hey, I want that piece of paper on my desk before you leave here today. Do you hear me?
The other guys to Pink "attitude adjustment", "get your priorities straight", "runs with a bad crowd", "bad people", blah blah blah. 
PINK
Yeah well. I've got coaches and everybody else's attitude adjusted priorities right here.
Pink screws up the form and throws it in the coaches general direction (though none of them see). 
BENNY
Yeah that's a good one.
They hear a car drive up. 
DON
Oh. Did you hear O'Bannion flunked?
BENNY
Yeah, what a dumb shit.
O'Bannion pulls up and gets out with his bat. 
O'BANNION
You all ready to bust some ass? What's up Don, Benny, Melvin good to see ya.
They say "see ya later" as Don and Pink leave. 
O'BANNION
Hey, we gotta take your truck. I'm low on gas. Alright?

BENNY
Take my truck?
O'BANNION
Yeah.
BENNY
Okay?
Melvin runs over, picks up the form Pink threw away. 
O'BANNION
Good. What are you doing?
MELVIN

O'BANNION
Picking up trash, what are you doing?
MELVIN
What?
INT. SCHOOL 
Pink and Don enter the school building and walk along. 
PINK
Man I was just waiting for one of them idiot coaches to piss me off again.
DON
I don't know. I think you take the whole thing a little bit too personal. I mean you just gotta... 
(looks around)
You gotta shake it off.
PINK
Don, have you ever thought about why we play football. I mean how many times have you gotten laid strictly because you're a football player, huh?
Upon passing through a doorway Don jumps at some nerd. 
DON
I don't know. A few probably.
PINK
Few. Don, all I'm saying is that I bet we could do just as well if we were in a band or something.
They reach a certain classroom. 
PINK
Look, I've got to put in a final appearance so...
DON
Wait a minute. Who you got going in there?
Don pears in through the open door. 
DON
Pisst. Vicky. Vicky. Come on lets go right now. Let's go get naked right now come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
The female teacher (MS. STROUD) appears in the doorway. 
MS. STROUD
Mr. Dawson.
DON
Yeah.
MS. STROUD
Why don't you take it somewhere else. Oh Mr Floyd are you gracing us with your presence today?
PINK
Er, might as well.
Pink enters the classroom. The teacher goes to shut the door but is stopped by Don's foot. 
DON
You know Jennie? I was thinking that you and I could maybe get together over the summer. I mean to won't be legal, we can make things happen. I'll keep it mum's the word I promise. I swear.
The teacher pats him on the head and shuts the door. 
INT. JUNIOR SCHOOL

Yes.
Pentico is at the doorway waving some car keys. 
PENTICO
Psst, hey.
CARL
Pentico got his brothers car. Let's go.
TOMMY
Cool. Go talk to him.
MITCH
I'm not going alone.
CARL
Come on.
The three of them nervously approach the teachers desk. 
MITCH
Er, Mr. Payne. Sir. You know every second that you could let us out early would really increase our chances of survival.
MR. PAYNE
It's like our sergeant told us before one trip into the jungle. Men.
The boys jump. 
Fifty of you are leaving on a mission. Twenty-five of you ain't coming back.
MITCH
Okay.
They walk away stunned. 
INT. CLASSROOM 
MS. STROUD
You know the '68 democrat convention was probably the most bitchin' time I even had in my life. Hey guys, one more thing. This summer when you're being inundated by all the American bicentennial fourth of July brouhaha. Don't forget what you're celebrating and that's the fact that a bunch of slave owning aristocratic white males didn't want to pay their taxes.
PINK
Yeah.
MS. STROUD
Have a good summer.

TONY
I know.

Yeah, he's er, kind of a joke. He's not a bad guy to have on your side though blocking for ya.
MITCH
Yeah. Did you get it bad when you were a freshman?
PINK
Shit man. Ah. They waited for my ass after baseball practice got me. God it was vicious. I mean actually it is best to get a lot at once you know, because after about ten licks your ass gets so numb you might as well get it over with. I don't know, I had some pretty cool seniors though. They'd take you out and bust the hell out of you then go get you drunk, you know stuff like that.
MITCH
Cool.

Thanks man.
PINK

Yeah, anytime. Er, hey man, look. Since the party is not going on me and some of the other guys will probably end up just riding around. You want us to stop by and pick you up?
MITCH
What you think that's a good idea?
PINK
Oh yeah, sure man no problem. Even after you've gotten it bad even the guys that haven't got you will give you a few days to rest. It'd be a pretty cool move to show up and let them know it doesn't bother you that much.
MITCH
Yeah okay, cool. 
PINK
See you later.
MITCH
Yeah sure. Thanks for the ride man.
PINK
Hey, man, er. Put some ice on it for a while. After that it won't be anything a few beers can't take care of.

Face it you got busted because you couldn't get away.
Tommy passes the bottle of beer to Carl. 
HIRSHFELDER
You try and out run O'Bannion and those guys. I'm going to be laughing my ass off when it's your turn. When they're busting your ass.
TOMMY
Hey man, heard last year. They caught about ten freshmen all at once. O'Bannion backed his truck over some pizzas and made them eat it man.
HIRSHFELDER
I mean that's bullshit right. Idiot flunks his senior year so he can be a dick two years in a row. Is that legal?
Carl slings the bottle over his shoulder into the air. 
TOMMY
Damn you Carl.
They sprint off as the bottle smashes. 
EXT. EMPORIUM 
O'Bannion's car turns in. Benny gets out. 
DON
Okay, let me out.
Don gets out from the rear. 
O'BANNION
Hey Slater you fucking hippy give me drugs man.
SLATER
Get some from your mother man.
O'BANNION
Yeah, we just banged your mother.
Benny gets back in. They accelerate off. 
SLATER
Okay, fuck you dickhead.
DON
***...That's nice man God man of the woods. God I haven't seen you in so long.
WOODERSON
My man, what is happening? Long time, no see. Yes sir.
DON
What have you been up to?
WOODERSON
Some old shit man.
DON
Yeah.
WOODERSON
Working for the city.
DON
Working man, huh.
WOODERSON
Been thinking about getting back in school though man.
DON
Back in JC or something like that?
WOODERSON
Yeah man. That's where all the girls are right?
DON
Yes they are.
WOODERSON
But on the other hand man I just as soon be working. Keep a little change in my pocket. Rather than spend my time listening to some dipshit who doesn't know what the hell he's talking about anyway.
DON
I know what you're talking about.
WOODERSON
Say you're a freshman right?
Pink grabs his belt buckle hitter and sparks it. 
MITCH
Yeah.
WOODERSON
So tell me man. How's this years crop of freshman chicks looking?
DON
Woods your really going to end up in jail sometime really soon I know that for a fact.
WOODERSON
No man, no. Let me tell you. That's what I love about these high school girls man. I get older they stay the same age.
DON
Yes they do.
WOODERSON
Yes they do.
PICKFORD
You guys want to go for a spin?
DON
Yeah. Shotgun!
PINK
Ah.
DON
Woods?
WOODERSON
I'm here man.
PINK
You wanna come along?
MITCH
Er yeah, why not?
PINK
Good bye.
WOODERSON
You boys have fun now.
PINK
See you later.
Slater gets out from Pickford's car. 
SLATER
Listen. I'm going to give to shotgun. But I want you to know it's because only 'cos I'm going inside. Keep that in mind alright.
MITCH
Hey man. Who's bowling ball is this?
PICKFORD
It's yours man.
SLATER
Hey man, what's happening?
WOODERSON
A little foosball.
SLATER
Yeah.
WOODERSON
Alright.
INT. PICKFORD'S CAR 
Pink tokes on a fatty. Passes it to Don, he has a puff. To Pickford. To Mitch. 
DON
Pull over to the trash can. Pull over to the trash can. Slow the trash can.
The car snails up to a trash can. Don leans out the window and grabs it. Car speeds off. A few houses later having got speed up he smashes it into a mailbox breaking it in the process. Everybody laughs "Yeah" etc... Mitch is new to this game and forces a grin. 
PINK
Hey you guys pull over to that one over there. Hold this.
Pink does exactly the same as Don just did. They all laugh... 
DON
Bowling ball.
PINK
Yeah.
DON
Throw the bowling ball.
MITCH
You think I should?
DON
Yeah.
PINK
Do it.
DON
Do it.
PINK
Do it.
DON
Do it.
PINK
Come on. You're playing with the big boys now.
DON
Do it. Do it. Throw it. Faggot sissy pussy freshman. Throw it, throw it.
PINK
Heave it.
Mitch launches it out the window sending it crashing through someone's rear car window. The guys are totally shocked. 
DON
Fuck 'em.
They then crack up. 
PICKFORD
That bowling ball said hoof to that damn windshield. You're nuts junior you're nuts.
DON
Hey man. We're out of beer we've got to make a grab and go stop.
PICKFORD
Right.
DON
I don't have any money. Who's got money?
PINK
I gave my money.
DON
Where's your money? Doesn't matter okay. Listen man, pull in heading out that way.
Pickford stops the car just outside a store. 
PICKFORD
What are you going to do man? Hoist it?
DON
Yeah, that's all I ever do. I just need the freshman as a look out.
PICKFORD
Hey I don't want to get into any trouble do you Randall Pink?
PINK
I don't know about this Don.
PICKFORD
Better be careful junior. Sunflower seeds
PINK
Zig-zags.
Don and Mitch head to the store. 
MITCH
Hey man, I'm not too sure about this.
DON
Shh. Okay I'm really going to pay for it, I'm just messing around with you okay. Good. 
DON
Run. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Lets go. Come on, lets go.
A car races up and stops behind them. Mitch and Don get back into the car. 
DON
Oh my God.
A man runs up to the car (Pickford's position) holding a gun. 
GUY WITH PISTOL
Alright . Now don't try anything or I'll shoot the shit out of ya.
PICKFORD
Don, give the beer back man.
DON
I paid for the beer man.
PICKFORD
Fuck.
GUY WITH PISTOL
You busted my mail box didn't ya? Look me in the eye punk.
PICKFORD
I don't know what you are talking about sir, but I suggest that you...
GUY WITH PISTOL
You busted it didn't ya? Tampering with mail boxes is a felony offense. Now I've done called the police. I think you boys ought to get out of the car.
He shove the gun into his pants. 
PINK
Just go man.
The man opens the door. 
GUY WITH PISTOL
Nice and slow.
DON
GO MOTHER...
Don slams it into gear. Pickford, foot down hard. The car flies off. The man who was holding on to the door is thrown to the ground. As they drive off the man pulls out his gun and tries to shoot them. 
PINK
Get down.
PICKFORD
He's shooting at us. Holy...
INT. CYNTHIA'S CAR 
TONY
Fairly uneventful huh?
CYNTHIA
Which one of you had the theory about how President Ford's old football head injuries is effecting the economy?
TONY
Did you know that Ford was on the Warren Commission?
MIKE
Who cares, he's out of there this fall. Look we need some alcohol.
TONY
That's a thought.
INT. EMPORIUM 
Melvin is playing pool. Pickford is passionately explaining the full details of the former dilemma to Wooderson. Slater is playing pinball. 
MELVIN
Say man, why don't you run over to the Cenntennial over there and pick me up a sixer of this stuff. Do you think you could do that?
MITCH
Er...
MELVIN
Thanks man.
WOODERSON
Good luck.
INT. CYNTHIA'S CAR 
MIKE
I'm saying if we're going to go out we shouldn't just drive around we should do something.
CYNTHIA
Yeah you're right man. I'm gonna just you know get drunk, maybe get laid, or get in a fight.
MIKE
No I'm serious man. We should be up for anything.
CYNTHIA
I know. We are. But what? I mean, God. Don't you ever feel like everything we do and everything we've been taught is just to service the future.
TONY
Yeah, I know. It's like it's all preparation.
CYNTHIA
Right, but what are we preparing ourselves for?
MIKE
Death.
TONY
Life at the party. It's true.
CYNTHIA
You know, but that's valid, because if we're all going to die anyway shouldn't we be enjoying ourselves now? You know, I'd like to quit think of the present, like right now as some minor insignificant pre-amble to something else.
MIKE
Exactly. That's what everybody in this car needs. Some good old worth-while visceral experience.
INT. LIQUOR STORE 
Mitch opens the fridge and takes out a six pack. The camera moves around to reveal a pregnant woman smoking and paying for hard liquor. 
LIQUOR STORE CLERK
Remember to eat a green thing everyday, and have lots of calcium. It's very important for young mothers to have lots of calcium. There you are. See you tomorrow night.
WOMAN
Bye.
The woman leaves 
LIQUOR STORE CLERK
How are you this evening?
Mitch takes some beef jerky from the jar on the counter. 
MITCH
Pretty good. How's it going?
LIQUOR STORE CLERK
It'll be a lot better when I get off in a couple of hours.
The clerk bags the sixer. 
MITCH
Yeah, I hear that.
LIQUOR STORE CLERK
You're eighteen right?
MITCH
Oh yeah. Just graduated.
LIQUOR STORE CLERK
Graduated. Congratulations. So are you off to collage in the fall?
MITCH
Ah you know I'm still not sure. I'm working right now, for the city. I'm thinking of holding on to the job for a while. It's like, you know money in my pocket.
LIQUOR STORE CLERK
I hear that. Here's some more money for your pocket. You have a nice night tonight.
He hands him the change. 
MITCH
Okay, thanks. Hey take it easy.
EXT. LIQUOR STORE 
Mitch leaves with a smug expression. 
CARL
Pissst. Hey Mitch.
Carl, Tommy and Hirshfelder cautiously emerge from around a corner. 
MITCH
Hey there you guys are.
TOMMY
Hey man, what's in the bag?
MITCH
Ah, sixer. You owe me one man.
CARL
Yeah, they busted the hell out of Hirshfelder to.
TOMMY
Hey man. Are you over at the Emporium.
MITCH
Oh yeah.
HIRSHFELDER
Hey. Is that bastard O'Bannion over there?
MITCH
Yes. I hate that jerk. Do you guys want to get him back?
HIRSHFELDER
Hell yes.
INT. EMPORIUM 
Mitch walks in with the beer under his arm. 
JULIE
They really sold that to you.
MITCH
'course.
JULIE
Cool.
Melvin pots black, wins the game, grabs the money. 
MELVIN
Here you go buddy.
WOODERSON
Pay check.
Mitch gives Melvin the beer. 
MELVIN
Oh yeah.
WOODERSON
Nice shooting man.
MELVIN
Thanks man.
MELVIN
Oh yeah. What have we got here?
MITCH
Here's your change to.
MELVIN
Ah don't worry about it man. A beer for my partner.
Hands a can to Wooderson 
MELVIN
Want a beer?
MITCH
Yeah.
Hands one to Mitch. 
MELVIN
Alright.
WOODERSON
Guys. Party at the Moon Tower.
PINK MELVIN
Oh. Beautiful. Oh, my man.
WOODERSON
You and me pick up the first two kegs. I'm going to collect for the rest. Spread the word man. Nashville, party at the Moon Tower.
MELVIN
Hey, good game man. You too.
He chucks the losers the remaining cans. Cut To: O'Bannion playing pool. Mitch walks by and whisper to Julie (during O'Bannion's below monologue). 
O'BANNION
You are an embarrassment to the sport of pool and should be proud that I even let you play at my table. You are the worse pool player I have ever seen in my life. But if you keep watching me, you might learn something. Shit, you've got so many balls on the table and going to have to start knocking your balls in just to get them out of my way. Corner pocket. Easy. God, you are terrible. Okay homo. I hope you are ready to take the agonizing, bitter humiliation of defeat.
Julie purposely walks by O'Bannion. 
JULIE
Have you heard that they are busting Carl Berneck out back?
O'BANNION
Woe, woe. What did you say?
JULIE
About what?
O'BANNION
Carl Berneck. What about him?
JULIE
I just heard he was getting busted. I don't know.
O'BANNION
Benny they've got Berneck out back. Lets go.
BENNY
Carl Berneck
O'BANNION
Yeah they got him.
BENNY
Outside?
O'BANNION
Yeah. Lets go, lets go.
BENNY
Gimme two, three minutes. Let finish this game right here.
O'BANNION
Ah come on, right now.
BENNY
You hold him for me.
O'BANNION
Alright, alright, alright.
O'Bannion dashes outside. Mitch is pleased with himself, Don comes over to him. 
DON
Hey man. That Julie chick. Loves you. Oh yeah. You want her? Got to play it cool you know. Can't let her know how much you like her, 'cos if she knows she'll dump you like that. Believe me. Like if she asks you to ride out there with her you don't do it. You say something like "Na, got my own ride. But maybe I'll see you later". Sounds stupid doesn't it? It works.
EXT. EMPORIUM 
O'Bannion runs over to a garage door where two guys have Carl lent against. A small crowd has gathered. 
O'BANNION
We got another one, how about it. Woe, woe, guys. You wouldn't mind if I went first here would you? Is that alright? It's kind of a personal thing between me and this piece of shit here. So. We meet again huh? Did you all hear this little motherfucker's mom pulled a shotgun on me this afternoon. Fucking bitch. You haven't had any licks yet have you?
CARL
No.
Carl moves slightly back, looks at him. 
O'BANNION
Woo. Another cherry boys. Get the fuck against the wall.
O'Bannion slams Carl back into the wall. 
O'BANNION
You know something you have to be the dumbest freshman, skinny, little, cocksucker, sonofabitch to be out here. You know that. You knew I was going to find you. I would like to dedicate this first lick to your mother. Fucker.
He swings the bat, practice stroke. 
O'BANNION
Oh ho, not yet.
Another practice stroke to wind Carl up. 
O'BANNION
It's getting warmer.
A white drop lands on O'Bannion's shoulder 
O'BANNION
What the fuck?
More paint slashes down. Carl legs it. 
HIRSHFELDER
Remember me you pig?
Squeal, squeal. Hirshfelder and Tommy are on the garage roof and empty the contents of two large tins of paint all over O'Bannion. Tommy and Hirshfelder make a swift getaway, jumping down from roof to roof. 
PENTICO
Hurry up you guys.
Through a gate to the car... 
CARL
It was beautiful. You should have seen the look on the fucks face. Get it.
Cut back to: O'Bannion pissed off shouting at people. 
O'BANNION
Jesus. You let that little fuck get away. What's the matter with you. It's fucking pitiful. Fuck. Freshmen shit heads. What the fuck are you looking at, huh? Kick your fucking ass right now.
He spots Mitch outside the Emporium and quickens his walk over. 
O'BANNION
What are you smiling at you little freshman faggot. Fuck you. Fuck all of you. Fuck you. Damn it.
O'Bannion smashes his bat on the ground, promptly gets in his car and speeds off. 
WOODERSON
Ah man.
PINK
O'Bannion finally got his paint job.
EXT. TOP NOTCH 
Cynthia is handed the fast food, she passes it around. 
TONY
Oh I can't believe I'm doing this. I swear to God that I never come to a Top Notch. And here I am sorting through Jalepeno burgers and soggy fries. Take 'em.
Wooderson pulls along next to Cynthia's car (Slater takes shotgun). 
WOODERSON
Alright, alright, alright.
MIKE
Oh Christ.
WOODERSON
How you doing?
CYNTHIA
Pretty good.
WOODERSON
Cool. You heard about the party being busted right?
CYNTHIA
Oh yeah.
WOODERSON
Yeah. Not to worry. There's a new fiesta in the making as we speak. It's out at the Moon Tower, full kegs, everybody's going to be there, you ought to go.
CYNTHIA
Okay.
MIKE
Okay, we'll be there.
WOODERSON
Say, you need a ride?
CYNTHIA
Er no I've got my own car. Thanks.
WOODERSON
Yeah well listen. You ought to ditch the two geeks your in the car with now and get in with us. But that's alright, we'll worry about that later. I will see you there. Alright?
CYNTHIA
Bye.
WOODERSON
I love those red heads man.
SLATER
Hey, I know you. We had Geography together. Remember?
Wooderson drives off. 
TONY
God.
MIKE
Dick!
Cynthia starts combing her hair with an Afro pick. 
TONY
That was so creepy. Urg.
MIKE
Why are you smiling?
CYNTHIA
I thought he was cute.
TONY
You though the was cute?
MIKE
Oh that's disgusting. Do you realize when he graduated we were like three years old?
TONY
Ah Cynthia what are you thinking?
CYNTHIA
I don't know.
She puts the comb down. 
CYNTHIA
So are we going to still go?
MIKE
Yeah, what the hell.
TONY
I guess.
EXT. ROAD TO MOON TOWER 
[montage sequence]
Shot: pans down from sky to pinks car (pink drives, Mitch in the middle, Don in shotgun), the KISS statues slung over the trunk.
Shot: CU on KISS statues, they are over taking...

Wooderson from the twenty first.
Shot: From Benny's car towards Wooderson's. 
WOODERSON
Hey Benny you better have your wood screws.
BENNY
Fuck you.
WOODERSON
Cos I'm going to blow your doors completely off.
Shot: static looking down the road, Benny and Wooderson race past side by side. 
EXT. MOON TOWER 
Shot: Shavonne and Sabrina exiting Jodi's Beetle, walk on right. Camera tracks with them stops on two guys in the next (convertible) car, doing what appears to be experimenting with a bong for the first time as they cough it out through their noses.
Shot: KISS statues lent against a tree.
Shot: A keg: one person pumps, the other fills a cup.
Shot: Darla and Simone partying.
Shot: Slater enthusiastically trying to sell some stash to punters.
Shot: Julie and her two pals happily trotting along.
Shot: Sabrina watching Clint and a couple of his mates shotgun cans of beer. Sabrina walks off.
Shot: Stoner and Wooderson chatting up a couple of girls.
Shot: Melvin dancing in the back of Benny's truck.
Shot: Slater smoking, sees a potential customer. 
Clint is lent against his car smoking pot with his mates. Mike, Tony and Cynthia stroll on by. 
MIKE
Man, someone's tokin' some reefer.
CLINT
Hey man. Hey slow down. What's up?
Clint attracts Mike's attention. 
MIKE
Hey how's it going?
CLINT
What did you just say?
MIKE
What?
CLINT
Just now man, when you walked past. What'd you say?
MIKE
About what?
CLINT
You said "someone's tokin' some reefer."
MIKE
No. I meant somewhere I smell some pot. You know? It was just an observation.
CLINT
Oh an observation huh? Well who the hell are you man? Isaac fucking Newton? Well guess what genius I'm the one smoking marijuana motherfucker. You got a problem with that?
MIKE
No of course not.
CLINT
Well why'd you say that chief? Come on man don't let your mouth write a check your butt can't cash. So I'm blazing with my friends man. So I'm a fucking pot head man. What's it to you huh?
Clint pushes Mike. 
CLINT
What's the matter pussy? Out of observations?
Clint pulls his T-shirt off and goes to start on Mike. 
CLINT
Well why don't you observe while I punch your fucking teeth down your throat? Come on.
Pink rushes in and breaks it up (by pushing Clint away) before anything can happen. 
PINK
You guys relax, relax. He's cool man. Relax.
CLINT
Hey, I'll be watching you Newton. I only came here to do two things man. Kick some ass and drink some beer. Looks like we're almost out of beer.
PINK
You okay man?
MIKE
Yeah.
Cut to Moon Tower: Pink, Mitch, Slater and Pickford climb the tower. 
MITCH
Why is it called the Moon Tower anyway?
PINK
Oh I guess they just decided to put it up out here whenever they were building the power plant. Actually it's a good idea. I mean you've got a full moon out here every day of the year, you know?
PICKFORD
Yeah, but nothings ever been repaired so this whole place could fall down at any time. So you better watch your step junior.
Pickford pretends he's falling "woooaa". 
SLATER
This place used to be off limits man 'cos some drunk freshman fell off he went right down the middle smacking his head on every beam man. I hear it doesn't hurt after the first couple though. Autopsy said he had one beer man. How many d'you have?
MITCH
Four.
SLATER
You're dead man. You're so dead. Look at the blood stains right there.
MITCH
Shut up.
Cut to: Mike, Cynthia and Tony (with beers) all lent against a car. 
MIKE
I'm going to get that guy.
CYNTHIA
What guy?
MIKE
That asshole on the way in, Clint. That super-dominant male in a fifties greaser uniform.
TONY
I wouldn't suggest that Mike.
MIKE
Look man I've got it all planed out. Most fights at places like this never get past a punch or two before they're broken up you know. There's almost this natural instinct not to upset the herd. All I've got to do is get in one good punch, play the offense and wait.
TONY
What?
CYNTHIA
What are you talking about?
MIKE
Well I guess at first I was relieved to get out of the situation you know. But now there's a level of humiliation setting in that I can tell is going to be with me for fucking ever. And I'm not going to let this but just another situation which contributes to me being a little ineffectual nothing the rest of my life, you know?
Cynthia and Tony laugh. Cut to Moon Tower: Slater takes in the view 
SLATER
Would you look at this fucking town man. It's dead. Imagine how people out there right now are fucking man.
PICKFORD
Step inside my hand.
SLATER
Just going at it.
Cut to: Sabrina walks over to Tony. 
SABRINA
Hey.
TONY
Hey.
SABRINA
Remember me?
TONY
Sure. You're Sabrina right?
SABRINA
Right.
TONY
How you doing?
SABRINA
Okay.
Cynthia signals to Mike. 
CYNTHIA
Lets go.
Cynthia and Mike walk off. 
TONY
What brings you here?
SABRINA
Oh, just hanging out.
Mike pats Tony on the back as he is walking away. Tony seems jumpy. 
TONY
You having fun?
SABRINA
Yeah. Yeah.
TONY
So er. Does your offer from this afternoon still stand?
SABRINA
What am I supposed to say? 'Anything you want.'
Cut to: Cynthia and Mike walking along. 
CYNTHIA
Why did we even come here? I always feel a little out of place at these things you know.
MIKE
You're telling me. You know I'm being stalked by a Nazi.
Cut to: Benny, Don and Pink, perched on a car. 
DON
Is that a little bit of reefer I smell on you boy. Coach is right you know. You're running with that bad crowd again. You've got an attitude adjustment you've got to make right now. You've got a lot of priorities to think about.
PINK
Like I'm the only athlete at this party. Look at you two drunks.
BENNY
Coach is right though. Those guys don't care if we win or lose Randall. Just remember that.
Don gets up. 
DON
Check this out. Watch this, both of you. Let me get this beer. Watch.
Don walks towards the keg where a massive queue has formed. 
DON
Oh no it's the cops. Look, look, look, look, look, look, look...
Everyone queuing departs. Don turns to Benny and Pink. 
DON
That was so easy.
PINK
Oh gee. He needs another drink, definitely. Bad.
Shot: A couple walk on by, pan right. Darla, being assisted to drink beer down a pipe and funnel (and half failing).

Shot: Mitch's POV.
Shot: Reverse.
Shot: Mitch's POV.
Shot: Back on Mitch walking around, Julie comes up to him. 
JULIE
Hey Mitch.
MITCH
Hey.
JULIE
How's it going?
Shot: Clint's mate throwing an empty cup at Clint provoking him to spit a mouth full of beer at him. 
INT. BENNY'S TRUCK 
Pink is having a serious talk with Benny. 
BENNY
So, er. I just wanna talk you know. About you quitting football. Or is it just this pledge, you don't want to sign the pledge right? That's what it is.
PINK
I don't know man. Maybe I'm not into any of it anymore.
BENNY
"Not into any of it anymore." Man it'll be the biggest mistake of your life Pink. No one quits senior year pal, especially if you're starting quarterback. I mean we've got a shot at state. You'll kick some butt this year. It's what we've been working for all of our lives man. Me and you. Benny we're going to be champions together.
PINK
Look man. All I'm saying is if I do play next year. It's going to be on my terms not theirs.
BENNY
You just remember one thing Pink: It ain't just about you pal. It's about us you know. Me, Donny, Mel. You'd be fucking us over. Or maybe you're just fucking scared, huh? Have a nice night.
Benny gets out and slams the door shut. 
EXT. MOON TOWER 
Shot: Darla drunken dancing. Simone stumbling over, falls at Darla's feet. Darla collaspes next to her laughing. 
Cut to: Michelle is sat on a car playing her guitar. Slater is toking hard. Pickford and Stoner lie on a car getting heavily stoned. 
PICKFORD
You guys know what that song's about? It's about aliens. We're the aliens man. We're the savages.
STONER
Wait man that song's about that?
SLATER
Yeah man that song's about that man.
STONER
It's about aliens?
SLATER
Yeah man, you didn't know that? This country is founded, it was found by people who were into aliens man. George Washington man, he was in a cult, and the cult was into aliens man. You didn't know that? Oh man they were way into that type of stuff man.
Cut to: Jodi, Kaye, Cynthia and Pink (leaning on a car). 
CYNTHIA
It's like the every other decade theory you know? The fifties were boring, the sixties rocked. The seventies, oh my God they obviously suck. Maybe the eighties will be radical you know. I figure we'll be in our twenties and hey, it can't get any worse.
Shot: someone filling a cup from a keg. Shot: Mike, alone, walking and drinking in the woods. 
Cut to: Jodi and Pink walking out of site into the woods. 
PINK
Wait a minute. Who put the keg way out here in the woods?
JODI
This is just where they told me it would be.
PINK
Oh yeah.
JODI
Yeah. I don't think we need beer anyway.
She flings away their cups of beer, grabs Pink - they kiss. 
Cut back to Slater. 
STONER
George toked weed man?
SLATER
Absolutely George toked weed. Are you kidding me man. He grew fields of fields of that stuff man. That's what I'm talking about. Fields.
STONER
He grew that shit up Mount Vernon man?
SLATER
Mount Vernon man. He grew it all over the country man. He had people growing it all over the country, you know.
Shot: Michelle relighting a joint, odd reaction to her lighter flame. 
The whole country back then was getting high. Let me tell you man, 'cos, 'cos, 'cos he knew. He was on to something man. He knew that it would be a good cash crop for the southern states man. So he grew fields of it man. But you know what? Behind every good man there's a woman. And that woman was Martha Washington man. And every day George would come home. She'd have a big fat bowl waiting for him man when he'd come in the door man. She was hip, hip, hip lady man.
Cut back to Pink and Jodi: They laugh around kiss, again. Pink starts to feel her right breast. 
JODI
Wait, wait, wait.
They break the kiss. 
PINK
What?
JODI
What are you doing?
PINK
I don't know.
JODI
Don't you have a girl friend?
PINK
What girlfriend?
JODI
What's her name? Simone. Hmm?

WOODERSON
Man, it's the same bullshit they tried to pull in my day. You know if it ain't that piece of paper it's some other choice they're going to try and make for you. You gotta do what Randall 'Pink' Floyd wants to man. And let me tell you this. The older you do get, the more rules they going to try to get you to follow. You just gotta keep livin' man. L.I.V.I.N.

PINK
How can you even pretend to talk that way huh?
COACH
Okay Randy I shouldn't do this but I'm willing to wipe the slate clean and forget about all this. I want you to finally get your priorities straightened out, quit hanging out with that bunch of hoodlums, and sign your commitment to your team. Have you done that yet?
PINK
I'm still thinking about it.
COACH

PINK
You know coach. I gotta get going. Me and my loser friends you know we gotta go get Aerosmith tickets. Top priority of the summer.
